An object is a composite value: it aggregates multiple values (primitive values or
other objects) and allows you to store and retrieve those values by name. An object is
an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value.

An object is a composite value: it aggregates multiple values (primitive values or
other objects) and allows you to store and retrieve those values by name. An object is
an unordered collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value.

JavaScript objects are dynamic—properties can usually be added and deleted—but
they can be used to simulate the static objects and “structs” of statically typed languages.

Any value in JavaScript that is not a string, a number, a Symbol, or true, false, null,
or undefined is an object. And even though strings, numbers, and booleans are not
objects, they can behave like immutable objects.

The most common things to do with objects are to create them and set, query, delete,
test, and enumerate their properties.
