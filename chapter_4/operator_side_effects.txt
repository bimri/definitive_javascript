The assignment operators are the most obvious example:
if you assign a value to a variable or property, that changes the value of any expression
that uses that variable or property. The ++ and -- increment and decrement
operators are similar, since they perform an implicit assignment. The delete operator
also has side effects: deleting a property is like (but not the same as) assigning
undefined to the property.

No other JavaScript operators have side effects, but function invocation and object
creation expressions will have side effects if any of the operators used in the function
or constructor body have side effects.
