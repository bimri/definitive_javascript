/* The simplest expressions, known as primary expressions, are those that stand alone—
they do not include any simpler expressions. 

Primary expressions in JavaScript are
constant or literal values, certain language keywords, and variable references. */

// Literals are constant values that are embedded directly in your program.
1.23                // A number literal
"hello"             // A string literal
// /pattern/           // A regular expression literal


// Some of JavaScript’s reserved words are primary expressions
true                // Evalutes to the boolean true value
false               // Evaluates to the boolean false value
null                // Evaluates to the null value
this                // Evaluates to the "current" object


// Finally, the third type of primary expression is a reference to a variable, constant, or
// property of the global object:
i                   // Evaluates to the value of the variable i.
sum                 // Evaluates to the value of the variable sum.
undefined           // The value of the "undefined" property of the global object
