"Order of Evaluation"
/* Operator precedence and associativity specify the order in which operations are performed
in a complex expression, but they do not specify the order in which the subexpressions
are evaluated. */

w = x + y * z

/* In the expression w = x + y * z, for example, the subexpression w is
evaluated first, followed by x, y, and z. Then the values of y and z are multiplied,
added to the value of x, and assigned to the variable or property specified by expression
w. */
