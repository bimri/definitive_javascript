"Object Creation Expressions"
/*
An object creation expression creates a new object and invokes a function (called a
constructor) to initialize the properties of that object. Object creation expressions are
like invocation expressions except that they are prefixed with the keyword new:
*/
new Object()
new Point(2,3)

/*
If no arguments are passed to the constructor function in an object creation expression,
the empty pair of parentheses can be omitted:
*/
new Object
new Date
